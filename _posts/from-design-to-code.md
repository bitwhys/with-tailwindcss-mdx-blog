# From Design To Code

## Notes
> On mobile, we can take it as a given that in each section, the left columns will stack on top of the right, and some other fairly typical reflow will happen.

>We’re going to do several passes through the design, and in all of them, we’re going **outside-in, top-to-bottom, and left-to-right** to ensure we evaluate every element.

## Overview
`TODO`

## Marketing Site Patterns
- big hero section
- product images
- small separate sections of short-form content emphasizing one thing or another
- information about the company



## Overall Design Pattern Categories
1. **Layout-level patterns** - repeating layout ideas and the overall grid
  - A header with a horizontal nav section
  -  A main content column within the content area—left and right edges align within all sections from header to footer
  -   Sections with two columns
  -   Sections with a single centered column
  -   Sections with a single left-aligned column
  -   A footer with three columns
  -   Fairly generous padding inside each section
2. **Element-level patterns** - headings, text sizes, fonts, spacing, icons, button sizes
3. **Color palette**
4. **Structural ideas** - the logical organization of sections, independent from the layout
5. **Everything else** - ideas that are only present in one component
