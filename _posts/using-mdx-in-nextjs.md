## Using `next-mdx-enhanced`
This solution is an older (not maintained) version of `next-mdx-remote` that attempted to enhance the experience of using mdx in next applications.

Similar to `@next/mdx` this solution is simply a  webpack loader that adds the ability to load `[mdx,md]` source files from the `pages` directory and generates routable pages in the next.js app.

Because it relies on the underlined file-system routing solution of next there is no need to fiddle with
